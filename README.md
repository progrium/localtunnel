Localtunnel
===========

Localtunnel lets you expose a local web server to the public Internet.

For example, running a web server on port 8000 on your laptop can be
made public with::

  $ localtunnel 8000
  Port 8000 is now available at http://8fde2c.localtunnel.com...

The localtunnel server is provided as a free public service. However you
can also deploy your own localtunnel server on dotCloud or your own
server.
